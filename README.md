# Scientific Calculator (C++)

Welcome to the Scientific Calculator repository! This project provides a fully functional scientific calculator implemented in C++. Whether you're a student, engineer, or scientist, this calculator offers a wide range of mathematical functions to assist you in your calculations.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with ease.

- **Trigonometric Functions**: Calculate sine, cosine, tangent, and their inverses for both degrees and radians.

- **Exponential and Logarithmic Functions**: Compute exponentials, natural logarithms, and logarithms to any base.

- **Square Root and Cube Root**: Find the square root and cube root of a number.

- **Factorial**: Compute the factorial of an integer.

- **Memory Functions**: Store and recall values using memory functions (M+, M-, MR, MC).

## Getting Started

To use the Scientific Calculator:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. Compile the source code using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++, Visual Studio, Code::Blocks).

3. Run the compiled executable file.

4. Use the keyboard or mouse to input numbers and perform calculations.

5. Explore the various functions available in the calculator's menu.

## Usage

Once the calculator is running, you can perform calculations by entering numbers and selecting the desired operations from the menu. Use the memory functions to store and recall values as needed. The calculator provides both a graphical user interface (GUI) and command-line interface (CLI) for ease of use.
